# End to End Sentiment Analysis Application

In this project, I am going through all the neccessary teps to build and deploy a Machine Learning Application. This project includes data collection, data preprocessing, model training and deployment.

Following steps in this project:
* Collecting and scraping customer reviews data using **Selenium** and **Scrapy**
* Training a deep learning sentiment classifier on this data using **PyTorch**
* Building an interactive web app using **Dash**
* Setting a **REST API** and a **Postgres database**
* Dockerizing the app using **Docker Compose**
* Deploying to **AWS** (In progress....)
